            <h3>
                Programming involves the creation, maintenance, and design of code.
                Computers operate on a binary system, processing information through positive signals. In this system, a positive signal is represented by 1, while the absence of a signal is represented by a 0.
                This binary framework is used by every computer on the planet.
                Despite its efficiency, binary is not user-friendly for humans.
                To be able to understand code programmers make use of something called programming languages.
                These languages provide a more user friendly way to communicate instructions to a computer, enabling developers to create software that automates tasks and processes data.
                These programming languages can be changed in an code editor.
                There are many types of programming.
                You can work on apps, websites, video games and far more.
                Each one of those carries unique challenges. Luckily for you other people who faced the same issues designed software that can help you program.
